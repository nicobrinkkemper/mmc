He had disguised himself as an enemy, forged an ID, and transformed into the perfect Buzzy Beetle. His mission was simple: secure classified documents and escape with as little attention as possible. But he knew all too well that nothing would go that smoothly. As he walked down the narrow hallway, Mario could hear his heart pounding in his chest. The enemy agents passing by him showed no suspicion. He kept his posture as confident as possible, acting as if this base was his workplace. However, at the end of the hallway, he encountered someone unexpected: Spike, the base’s division leader and a notoriously sharp green agent. As soon as Spike saw him, a subtle smile appeared on his face. “A Buzzy Beetle I’ve never seen before,” Spike said, his voice soft but tinged with sharp suspicion. “Which unit are you with?” Mario worked hard to maintain his composure as he answered, “I’m a support agent from headquarters. I’ve been ordered to deliver documents.” Spike’s eyes gleamed sharply. He slowly scanned Mario’s face, as if ready to launch a slow-motion spiked ball from his mouth at any moment. “Headquarters, huh? Then why isn’t your face in the records?” Mario’s hand unconsciously moved toward the dagger on his waist but stopped short. A fight here would mean mission failure. He decided to stall for time. “Perhaps the latest records haven’t been updated yet. If necessary, would you like to contact headquarters now?” Mario smiled as if he was calm. Spike was silent for a moment. As he scrutinized Mario, the spy was quickly calculating escape routes in his mind. Finally, Spike smiled and said, “Interesting. But verifying this will take some time. Until then, stay here and work with me.” Spike’s gaze clearly carried the intent to test him. Mario felt nervous but kept a confident expression. “Understood. I’ll follow your orders.” They headed to the operations room together, where piles of classified documents lay stacked. Spike deliberately instructed Mario to organize specific files. Mario immediately sensed it was a trap. As he sorted through the files, Mario could feel Spike’s eyes on his back, like a predator watching its prey. Yet he made no mistakes, acting skillfully as if he were truly an enemy agent. When the task was finally complete, Spike asked, “How much do you know about the contents of these documents?” Mario hesitated for a moment before smiling and replying, “I’m merely a delivery agent. I don’t need to know the details.” Spike stared at Mario for a moment before smirking meaningfully. “Very well. But next time, I’ll have to investigate you more thoroughly.” As soon as the conversation ended, Mario turned and struck Spike precisely at the back of his neck. He had noticed Spike gathering clues about his identity through the tasks he had assigned. Spike staggered and fell backward but quickly assumed a counterattack stance. “So, you are a spy,” Spike said with a smirk. Mario didn’t waste time. He immediately twisted Spike’s arm and delivered another precise blow to a vital point, giving him no chance to fire a spike ball from his mouth. Despite resisting, Spike eventually succumbed to Mario’s ambush and lost consciousness. Mario checked his pulse before laying him in a corner of the room. Then he quickly secured Spike’s radio and tidied up the scene. “Time to start again,” he muttered to himself as he left the room. Walking briskly through the hallway, he recalculated his infiltration and escape routes. Gritting his teeth, he made a silent vow: I will complete this mission no matter what.","makerDescription":{"type":"span","key":"outer","props":{"children":"ShuShuro and WBC are Korean creators who focus on looping music and gimmick courses.
