After a fierce debate, they needed a tie breaker between \"some place frosty\" and \"some place hot\". Toadette thinks of a brilliant idea, \"why not both at Mount Jumpmore!\"\n\nMount Jumpmore is a luxury ski resort, with warm, lava heated spas that are to die for! This is a pretty pricey resort though, even Luigi would think twice before coughing up the cash! Banktoad (yes seriously, that's his name!) claims he can find a great deal with his \"methods\" though, so against the Captain's better judgment, they book a flight with Booster Air…\n\nFlash Forward to now, where they've arrived at their destination. Barely able to contain his excitement, Banktoad jumps into the air and explains \"READY FOR VACATION!\". This is where things took a turn for the worse..\n\nThe moment the poor green toad jumps, a P-switch activation is heard… and the floor beneath him disappears, causing him to fall to his doom! \n\nMailtoad (seriously why are these toads named after their jobs?), being the nervous sort, long jumps to a cloud. But far from being safe, life had a different package in mind: a blaster delivered to the top of his head!\n\n\"Oh those idiots, this isn't Mount Jumpmore… it's MOUNT JUMPLESS!\" screams Hint Toad (is that even a job?!)\n\nMount Jumpless is the notorious (and far cheaper!) mountain NEXT to Mount Jumpmore. This isn't a resort: it's a deadly set of lava infested ruins that's been claiming the souls of Toad explorers for the past 280 years! Legends say a strange flying reptile cursed a once proud civilization to misfortune whenever they jumped… and that sure seems to be in action to this day!\n\nAnd yet, Toadette smiles wryly, because there's a bright side to this disaster: legends also told of the ancient civilization hiding away a wonderful flying machine, one that you don't even need to jump with! But to reach this incredible treasure, you'll need to find the 4 sacred \"secret exits\", and plunder the pink tokens within.\n\n\"Are you crazy Toadette?! Did you even comprehend what just happened to those two? Forget the treasure, we gotta get outta here!\"\n\nBut it was no use, Toadette doesn't care about meager \"dangers\", she was here to make her fortune by claiming the legendary flying machine!\n\nAnd that's where you come in: will you side with Toad and simply fight for survival, or will you join Toadette to find the 4 secret paths soar to the skies… WITHOUT JUMPING!","makerDescription":{"type":"span","key":"outer","props":{"children":"Theorymon's a guy on the internet who plays way too much Mario, competitive Pokemon, and Touhou!
