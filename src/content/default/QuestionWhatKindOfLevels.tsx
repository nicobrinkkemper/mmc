            The project's scope is broader than ever. You'll find platformers, gimmicks, puzzles, music levels, trolls and many more level types. Each maker plays to their own strengths to make an as accomplished, original and polished level they can. If you look into the weekly batches here on this website, you'll find short descriptions as well as category tags and a difficulty rating. This way you should be able to find something that suits you.
