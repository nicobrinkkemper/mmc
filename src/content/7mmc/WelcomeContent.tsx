            Here you will find visual elements from the project: Logos, illustrations and other goodies. These are free to use for thumbnails, video overlays and other purposes. New elements will be released every week, so if you bookmark the folder youâ€™ll have access to these as soon as they are made available.

                The anniversary project is under new management and a new banner, but you'll still see many familiar names crop up along with new ones as we celebrate another year of Mario Maker. Every weekend across the next couple of months we'll publish a batch of varied and rigorously playtested levels!
            </p>
            <p>
                Every level has birthday balloons for you to discover. Can you find them all?
