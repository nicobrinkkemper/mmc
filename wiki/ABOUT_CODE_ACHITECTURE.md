# About the Code Architecture in this repository

The Mario Maker level maker community is a global community of people who love to build.
If you've stumbled upon this repository, you're probably interested in how this code works... you found the right place!

Even though the Mario Maker community might love to build, we might not all be software developers!
That's why, I will explain the code architecture in a way that is easy to understand for everyone.

# geitje/bbmariomaker2's contraption design

If you you don't know who bbmariomaker2 and or geitje is in the Mario Maker community, here's a list of things you may know me for:

- MarI/O / infinite freeze detector contraption level
- Song of Storms, Wrecking Crew, Bombastic Pirates Fortress, Death Mountain, Lost Woods. First of it's kind global looping music levels.
- Larry's Sabotage Mission, super fast and even the first 3DW global reusable jump detector ever made
- Mario Math - The first RNG math level ever made
- First discovery of the hammer bro + claw undo glitch (commonly used for glitch sequences)
- Some post from 2020 still get discussed today, the "resetters/flippers/useless-machines/triggers" always stay relevant
- I've written three long Mario Maker guide. Mario Maker RNG Guide, Mario Maker Global Music Guide and Geitje's contraption building guide.
- Of course, couldn't have done it without the community and everyone in the [discords](https://discord.gg/R8aYkzzH)
